Agent: IRON

This agent installs and runs IRON. It required a staged IRON tarfile in /proj/edgect/groups/iron/tarfiles.
The tarball name must be of the form "iron_$EXP.tgz" where $EXP is the name of the experiment the tarfile
is meant to be installed and executed on. (It is per experiment as there is embedded topology/name information
in the configuration files in the tarball.)
